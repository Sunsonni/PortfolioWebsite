        <h3>Why coding?</h3>
        <p>
        I’ve been surrounded by technology since I was little and always loved solving problems. Whenever technology came into play, my family would come to me to fix it. I was their personal IT getting viruses off of their computers since middle school. 

        Interestingly enough I didn’t automatically go into computer science. I did some small coding projects on my own but I never formally learned programming until I went through a LaunchCode course in 2024. Now I’m back in school getting my degree in Computer Science at SIUE.

        <h3>What are you currently learning and exploring? </h3>
        <p>
        Formally in school, I’m learning about how computers read code and C++ concepts but personally I’ve been playing around with AI and chat bots. I’ve been working on a Gemini based chatbot, toying with the idea of gamifying it and adding a relationship value to the ‘character’ that increases or decreases depending on how the ‘character’ likes the response.

        <h3>What’s your process for problem-solving?</h3>
        <p>
        I write things down and try to understand what exactly it is I’m trying to do. Most of the time it's scribbles that only I understand. I find that when I don’t write things down, it’s easy to get bogged down by the details and forget the main focus.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So I write it down. 
        Then I come up with possible solutions and do them.
        Sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t.
