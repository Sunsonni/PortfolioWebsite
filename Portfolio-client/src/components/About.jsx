        <p>Hi, I’m Sonnie Nguyen, a Computer Science student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.</p> 
        <h5>Why coding?</h5>
        <p>
        I’ve been surrounded by technology since I was little and always loved solving problems. Whenever technology came into play, my family would come to me to fix it. I was their personal IT getting viruses off of their computers since middle school. 

        Interestingly enough I didn’t automatically go into computer science. I did some small coding projects on my own but I never formally learned programming until I went through a LaunchCode course in 2024. Now I’m back in school getting my degree in Computer Science at SIUE.
        </p>
        <h5>What are you currently learning and exploring? </h5>
        <p>
        Formally in school, I’m learning about how computers read code and C++ concepts but personally I’ve been playing around with AI and chat bots. I’ve been working on a Gemini based chatbot, toying with the idea of gamifying it and adding a relationship value to the ‘character’ that increases or decreases depending on how the ‘character likes the response. 
        </p>
        <h5>What’s your process for problem-solving?</h5>
        <p>
        You probably aren’t actually curious but I’ll answer anyway.

        I am a stringent writer. Meaning that I write it down and try to understand what exactly it is I’m trying to do. I find that when I don’t write things down, it’s easy to get bogged down by the details and forget the main focus. 
        So I write it down. 
        Then I come up with possible solutions and do them.
        Sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t.</p>
